1) I need help developing the philosophers 42 school project.
	I have a very basic understanding of how thread functions work in C, like phread_create() and pthread_join()
2) I want to use test driven development (TDD) to develop the project. I have little knowledge of TDD. 
3) Always explain the concepts involved in your answers.
4) always provide your code suggestions following the requirements of the 42 norm, norminette and the
	philosophers subject uploaded to you. 42 norm includes: functions can have a maximum of 5 local variables
	and receive a max of 4 parameters. declaration and assignment of variables must be done in separate lines.
	Curly braces must be the only character in a line. global variables are not allowed.
